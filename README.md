# PASSWORD LOCKER

## Author
Levert Ouma

### Description
An application that allows a user to generate and store passwords for various accounts.They can also view and delete the passwords they created.
 
### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to create a password locker account with my details, a login username and password.

2. As a user, I want to store my already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming I already have a twitter account, I want to store my already existing twitter username and password in the application.

3. As a user, I want to create new account credentials in the application. For example, if I have not yet signed up for Instagram, I would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when I sign up for Instagram. 

4. As a user, I want to have the option of putting in a password that I want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, I want to have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.

5. As a user, I also want to view my various account credentials and their passwords in the application.

6. As a user, I want to delete a credentials account that I no longer need in the application.
 
### How to Use
1. As soon as the user enters the application, he/she will be prompted to enter their name and password which will then be used to access their stored passwords.

2. The user will have an option of..
    1. Adding a new password.

    3. Viewing their stored passwords.
    4. Deleting a stored password.
